# JS style guide

Just in case I ever touch JavaScript code ever again:

- One-liner functions should use arrow functions and larger functions (either with more params or more code) should use plain functions
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for module constants (no i'm not using just `const`)
- Keep your individual logic and components connected
- uhh idk do I even need this?
